# Project Rules and Tasks

## Rules

1. Do not change the interface of the app unless you are doing it for functionality.

## Tasks

- [x] Set up a new Vite React project (with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS)
- [x] Remove all Next.js-specific dependencies and configuration files
- [x] Identify all pages and routes to migrate (app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx, app/dashboard/page.tsx, app/goal/[id]/page.tsx)
- [x] Migrate pages from the `app/` directory to React Router structure (React Router installed, routes scaffolded)
- [x] Migrate Home page to Vite React app
- [x] Update routing to use React Router instead of Next.js file-based routing
- [x] Move and adapt layouts and shared components (Layout component created and used)
- [x] Migrate Dashboard page to Vite React app
- [x] Migrate Goal page (dynamic route) to Vite React app
- [x] Update dynamic routes (e.g., `[id]`) to React Router params
- [x] Move global styles and Tailwind config (globals.css migrated and imported)
- [x] Update asset imports (images, etc.) to Vite conventions
- [x] Refactor any Next.js-specific code (e.g., `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, etc.)
- [x] Update environment variables and configuration for Vite
